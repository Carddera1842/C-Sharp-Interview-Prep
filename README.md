# C# Interview Prep

This repository is dedicated to my preparation for C# developer interviews. 
I'm using a structured curriculum based on Pluralsight courses, labs, and guided 
exercises to strengthen my understanding of core C# concepts, object-oriented 
programming, and advanced topics such as LINQ and asynchronous programming.

## 📚 Current Curriculum

The following Pluralsight courses form the foundation of this prep:

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- **C#: The Big Picture** – *Mike Woodring*
- **C# Fundamentals** – *Gill Cleeren*
- **Debugging C#** – *Neil Morrissey*
- **Object-oriented Programming in C#** – *Gill Cleeren*

### 🔹 Guided Labs
- **Exploring the Pillars of Object-oriented Programming in C#**
- **Delegates and Events in C#**

### 🔹 Intermediate to Advanced Topics
- **Error Handling in C#** – *Jason Roberts*
- **LINQ Fundamentals in C#** – *Paul D. Sheriff*
- **Asynchronous Programming in C#** – *Filip Ekberg*

More courses will be added over time as I progress.

## 🛠️ Structure

This repo includes:
- ✅ Notes and takeaways from each course
- 💻 Code snippets and mini-projects to reinforce key concepts
- 🧪 Practice problems and interview-style coding challenges

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in modern C# and the .NET ecosystem
- Practice real-world debugging, error handling, and async workflows
- Prepare for technical interviews and whiteboard/code-pair sessions
- Gain confidence in using C# for object-oriented and functional-style programming
